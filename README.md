# Communicate Findings: Ford GoBike Dataset
## by Anita Obarakpor


## Dataset

Ford GoBike is a bike sharing system available in San Fransisco. Similar to other bike share systems, Ford GoBike consists of a fleet of bikes that can be unlocked in one station and returned in any other network station. Thus, this is ideal for one-way trips. These bikes are available for use thorughout the year and riders have access to all bikes in the network.

The dataset can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorinoeng/fordgobike20172019 and contains information about over 3 million bike trips taken from 2017 to 2019. Information documented include 
 - Bike Id
 - Start and End Station Id
 - Start and End Station Latitude and Longitude
 - Trip Duration
 - Age
 - Gender
 - Time Details for Trips
 
Some data wrangling was done to convert month and day of week from integer to string format. New fields were also created for age range and distance travelled.
The dataset was investigated to discover which factors contributed most greatly to the frequency of rides.

## Summary of Findings

From my exploration I discovered that 
1. Majority of the users were male and had an active subcription to the service.
2. Most subscribers use the service for weekday work and school commutes while non-subscribed customers used it more on weekends for leisure.
3. There is no particular demographic of people that is most likely to subscribe. All ages and genders have subscriptions. 
4. The most active users fall between the ages of 20 and 40.
